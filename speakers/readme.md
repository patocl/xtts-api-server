# Speakers Directory

This directory is used to store `.wav` files that represent different speakers for the TTS (Text-to-Speech) service.

You can add more `.wav` files here, and the service will be able to use them for generating speech with different voices.

### How to add new speakers:

1. Place your `.wav` files in this directory.
2. Ensure that the files are in a format that is compatible with the TTS system.
3. Once added, the service will automatically recognize and use these files for voice synthesis.

Note: Make sure that the `.wav` files are properly named and formatted according to the service's requirements.

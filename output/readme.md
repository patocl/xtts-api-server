# Output Directory

This directory is used to store the generated output files from the application. These files include:

- **Transcriptions**: Text files containing transcriptions of the audio processed by the system.
- **Logs**: Any log files related to the processing and operation of the application.
- **Generated Data**: Any other data or results generated by the system during its execution.

## Purpose

The `output` directory is intended to persist the results produced by the application, ensuring that files remain available even after the container is stopped or restarted. This directory is mapped as a volume in the Docker container, allowing for easy access to output data from your host machine.

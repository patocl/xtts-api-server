# Models Directory

This directory is used to store the models used by the TTS (Text-to-Speech) service.

You can place different models here for the service to load and use for generating speech. The models should be compatible with the TTS system to ensure proper functionality.

### How to add new models:

1. Place your model files in this directory.
2. Ensure the models are in the correct format and compatible with the TTS service.
3. Once added, the service will automatically load and use them for speech synthesis.

Note: Make sure that the model files are well-organized and named according to the service's requirements.
